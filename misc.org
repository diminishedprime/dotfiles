** xps 9360 backlight issue?
   I haven't figured out exactly what the cause of it was, but it seems like
   hibernation or sleep can cause issues with this laptop's screen backlight. At
   some point (I think after waking it up from either hibernation or sleep,
   though I can't really remember for sure) the backlight got stuck on max
   brightness. One thing that was weird about this is the bios has a brightness
   control (for some reason) and it was still working so I was pretty sure it
   wasn't a hardware issue. I did try installing windows and it didn't seem to
   fix the problem there either, but I was focused on trying to apply a patch
   (for a previous generation) so I might have missed it. Either way, I was able
   to fix the problem by running these 3 commands, though I think it was just
   the third that fixed it.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     systemctl suspend
     pm-suspend
     pm-hibernate
   #+END_SRC
